### Show some ‚ù§Ô∏è and star the repo to show support for the project

<h1 align="center"> Munche Android App </h1>

Munche is an open source üçî food ordering android application developed in **Java** and **Kotlin**. Munche is mainly developed so I can improve my android development skills by building a real world application and experiment with different android components.

# ‚òÅÔ∏è Inspiration

Munche's main inspiration for it's UI comes from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.application.zomato&hl=en_IN&gl=US">Zomato's</a> android app. I have incorporated some of the UI elements and features which the Zomato app had when I was developing the app.

# ‚ú® Features

Some of the features of Munche app are:

- User Authentication using Phone Number.
- Browse different restaurants and menu items.
- Place order for different items from the menu and see them in a cart.
- Set your delivery location on the app accurately.
- Payment options include : <a href="https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/product-overview">UPI</a> (Unified Payment Interface), <a href="https://developer.paytm.com/docs/v1/android-sdk/">Paytm</a> and COD.
- See the route and distance from the restaurant's location to yours.
- See and write reviews for different restaurants.
- See all your orders in the orders page.
- Search available restaurants.
- and more...

# üìö Major Libraries Used

- Firebase Suite - For Auth, Database and Storage
- Mapbox - Mapbox is used to integrate the map and build the route generation functionality.
- Glide - For Image Loading.
- Paytm SDK - For Paytm Payment Integration.
- Lottie - To Display native `json` animations in android.
- Smiley Rating Bar.

# üíª Build Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AdityaV025/Munche.git
```

2. Import the project into Android Studio.

3. Create a firebase project and add this android app to the project.

4. Run the below command in the terminal to get your **SHA-1** key and upload it in the project settings in your firebase console, without this you cannot authenticate users using their phone numbers.

```shell
keytool -exportcert -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

5. Enable Phone Number sign in Firebase Authentication Tab in the left side.

6. Download and add the `google-services.json` file from the firebase project you created earlier and add it to the project under **app** folder.

7. Get your Mapbox Token and paste it in the `strings.xml` file

```
<string name="mapbox_access_token">REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN MAPBOX TOKEN</string>
```

8. Also paste the token in the `gradle.properties` file

```
MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN=REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN MAPBOX TOKEN
```

9. Setup a server which will generate a **CHECKSUM** Hash for the paytm sdk to work.After creating the server please paste the url which will return the **checksum** hash in the `CheckoutActivity.java` under the *ui/order* folder.Replace the GENERATE_CHECKSUM_URL with your own server url.

```java
public class sendUserDetailToServer extends AsyncTask<ArrayList<String>, Void, String> {
        private ProgressDialog dialog = new ProgressDialog(CheckoutActivity.this);
        //private String orderId , mid, custid, amt;
        String url ="GENERATE_CHECKSUM_URL";
```

10. Run the project into an emulator or a physical device.
